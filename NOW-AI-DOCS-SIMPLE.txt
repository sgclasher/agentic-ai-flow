# ServiceNow Agentic AI: Comprehensive Guide

## Part 1: Foundations, Use Cases, and Agent Configuration

### 1. Introduction to ServiceNow Agentic AI

**What are Now Assist AI Agents?**

* Now Assist AI Agents are intelligent entities within ServiceNow that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks ranging from simple automation to complex problem-solving[cite: 11].
* They operate based on a set of instructions and tools to achieve specific goals, such as resolving incidents or cases[cite: 12, 48].
* Their primary aim is to reduce the workload of human agents and enhance productivity[cite: 13, 41].
* AI Agents are designed to leverage your ServiceNow data, workflows, and integrations natively and securely[cite: 50].
* They can dynamically adjust their actions based on progress and changing conditions to stay focused on their objectives[cite: 51].

**Key Terminology** [cite: 46]

* **Agentic System:** A type of software or AI that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. It can learn, adapt, and operate independently[cite: 46, 47]. ServiceNow's agentic framework is an example of this.
* **AI Agent:** Within the Now Platform, an AI agent consists of LLM instructions combined with tools (like skills, scripts, flows) to perform specific tasks[cite: 48, 3020].
* **Use Case:** In the ServiceNow agentic system, a use case defines an objective and comprises LLM instructions along with one or more AI agents needed to execute it[cite: 49].
* **Skill:** A generative AI capability assigned to an AI agent to perform specific tasks (e.g., summarization, classification, content generation)[cite: 3020]. Skills are a type of tool agents can use.
* **Tool:** Capabilities leveraged by AI Agents, including skills, scripts, flows, retrievers, etc.[cite: 48, 3020, 3028].
* **Orchestrator:** A coordinating entity within the agentic framework that manages collaboration between multiple agents, routing requests and facilitating complex task completion[cite: 68]. It can also interact with agents to get missing context or handle failures iteratively[cite: 69, 70].

**Capabilities & Benefits** [cite: 52]

* Dynamically plan incident/case resolution[cite: 52].
* Collaborate with other AI agents for subtasks[cite: 53].
* Incorporate human feedback when needed[cite: 53, 55].
* Handle knowledge-intensive tasks[cite: 54].
* Find solutions using multiple knowledge sources or similar incidents[cite: 54].
* Define specific flows to avoid unnecessary iterations[cite: 55].

**Important Considerations:**

* **AI Limitations:** AI/ML models generate predictions based on data patterns and may not always be accurate, complete, or appropriate[cite: 29, 32, 3787, 3788]. It's crucial to test, evaluate, and employ human oversight, especially for consequential use cases[cite: 34, 35, 3790, 3791].
* **Data Processing & Privacy:** Data may be transferred to centralized ServiceNow environments (potentially in different regions) or third-party providers like Microsoft Azure[cite: 37, 3793]. Data handling adheres to ServiceNow policies[cite: 38, 3794].
* **Data Collection for Improvement:** ServiceNow collects inputs/outputs to improve its technologies. Customers can opt out[cite: 39, 40, 3795, 3796].
* **Availability:** Some Now Assist features may have regional or environmental restrictions (e.g., FedRAMP)[cite: 23, 26, 3779, 3782]. Check ServiceNow KB articles for details[cite: 24, 27, 3780, 3783].

### 2. Identifying and Implementing AI Agent Use Cases

Identifying the right use cases is critical for success. Follow a structured approach:

**Step 1: Analyze (Identify Opportunities)** [cite: 2214]

* Think of AI Agents as virtual workers capable of handling tasks currently done by humans[cite: 2214].
* Focus on areas with potential for significant automation, especially high-volume transactional processes (cases, incidents)[cite: 2215].
* Consider under-resourced domains like knowledge management, problem management, or continuous improvement[cite: 2216].
* **Demand-Driven Approach:** [cite: 2217]
    * **Ticket/Feedback Analysis:** Analyze inquiries, incidents, and HR cases to find recurring themes or issues suitable for AI[cite: 2217].
    * **Identify Repetitive Tasks:** Look for time-consuming, repetitive tasks frequently reported as blockers or resulting in new tickets[cite: 2218].
    * **AI-Powered Analysis:** Use AI itself to categorize inquiries and identify emerging issues or potential use cases[cite: 2219, 2220].

**Step 2: Assess (Qualify Use Cases)** [cite: 2225]

* Determine if an AI Agent is the *right* solution. Not all automation needs an agentic approach[cite: 2223]. Simple tasks might be better suited for standard Now Assist skills triggered manually[cite: 2224].
* Consider AI Agents when: [cite: 2226]
    * **Contextual Understanding is Needed:** The process requires interpreting nuanced language, ambiguity, or diverse data formats beyond rule-based automation[cite: 2226].
    * **Frequent Variations/Updates:** Workflows or source data (policies, KBs) change often, making static automation difficult to maintain. AI Agents adapt more easily[cite: 2227, 2228].
    * **Scaling Expertise is Valuable:** You need to replicate and scale subject matter expertise currently held by a few individuals[cite: 2228].
    * **Complex Decision-Making:** The task involves multi-step reasoning, evaluating options, or synthesizing information from various sources[cite: 2228].
    * **Human-in-the-Loop is Beneficial:** Tasks require occasional human judgment, approval, or intervention within an automated process[cite: 2228].

**Step 3: Prioritize**

* (Details likely in subsequent sections of `servicenow-ai-agents-plan.txt` - will be covered later if present) Evaluate qualified use cases based on factors like business value, feasibility, complexity, data availability, and strategic alignment.

**Step 4: Implement**

* (Details likely in subsequent sections of `servicenow-ai-agents-plan.txt`, `Now Assist Skill Kit – Implementation Guide.txt`, `yokohama_enable_ai_now_assist_ai_agents...txt` - will be covered later) Design, build, test, and deploy the AI Agent solution using tools like AI Agent Studio and Now Assist Skill Kit.

### 3. Configuring the Agentic AI Experience

**AI Agent Studio** [cite: 20, 62]

* The central hub for configuring the agentic AI experience[cite: 20].
* Provides guidance ("Steps to success") for implementing AI agents[cite: 62, 66].
* Used to create custom AI agents, potentially using advanced multi-agent reasoning frameworks[cite: 21].
* Allows creation and management of use cases, including defining instructions and triggers[cite: 22].
* Enables cloning and modification of existing use cases (base system use cases are read-only)[cite: 56, 57].
* Provides an interface (Agent Studio Chat, Now Assist panel) to interact with agents and view outputs, including citations from tools like knowledge search[cite: 76].

**AI Agents Orchestrator** [cite: 67]

* Manages how teams of AI agents collaborate[cite: 67, 68].
* Routes requests between agents to accomplish complex tasks[cite: 68].
* Can retrieve missing context or information by interacting with involved agents[cite: 69].
* Handles situations where an agent gets stuck, enabling iterative problem-solving[cite: 70].
* Helps manage, govern, and track the value of AI agents and use cases across the enterprise (via AI Agent Control Tower functionality)[cite: 67].

# ServiceNow Agentic AI: Comprehensive Guide

## Part 2: Now Assist Skill Kit & Skill Design

### 4. Now Assist Skill Kit (NASK) Overview

* The Now Assist Skill Kit is the ServiceNow toolkit for creating and publishing custom generative AI capabilities (Skills) for Now Assist and, by extension, AI Agents.
* It allows developers to build tailored Skills beyond the pre-built ones offered by ServiceNow.
* **Key Functionality:**
    * Define triggers for when a skill should activate.
    * Implement pre-processing logic to prepare data for the LLM.
    * Craft detailed prompts to instruct the LLM.
    * Manage context provided to the LLM using various tools.
    * Implement post-processing logic to format or act upon the LLM's output.
    * Test and publish skills for use within the platform.
* **Important Note:** NASK enables creating *new* workflow-related skills within the scope of your Now Assist licenses. You should leverage licensed, pre-built Now Assist skills (like Incident Summarization) where available and avoid creating duplicative versions of licensable skills. Custom skills *can* be built using NASK to operate on custom tables included in your licenses.

### 5. Skill Design and Development Principles

Designing effective skills involves several key stages:

**5.1 Triggering Skills**

* Skills need defined triggers to initiate their execution within a workflow or AI Agent's plan.
* **Common Trigger Mechanisms:**
    * **UI Actions:** Buttons or links clicked by a user.
    * **Flow Designer Actions:** Skills can be embedded as actions within automated workflows.
    * **Agent Workspace Events:** Actions taken within the Agent Workspace interface.
    * **AI Agent Orchestration:** An AI Agent, guided by its instructions and the Orchestrator, can decide to invoke a specific skill as part of its task execution plan.
* The trigger mechanism often provides the initial context or input data for the skill (e.g., the current incident record).

**5.2 Pre-Processing**

* This stage prepares the input data *before* it's sent to the LLM along with the prompt.
* **Purpose:**
    * **Format Data:** Structure data in a way the LLM can easily understand.
    * **Filter Information:** Remove irrelevant data to keep the context concise and focused.
    * **Extract Key Details:** Pull specific fields or information needed for the prompt.
    * **Anonymize/Mask Data:** Protect sensitive information (PII) before sending it to the LLM (See Responsible AI section later).
* **Implementation:** Often done using ServiceNow platform capabilities like Scripts (JavaScript) or Flow Designer logic.

**5.3 Prompt Engineering**

* This is the art and science of crafting effective instructions (prompts) for the LLM to achieve the desired outcome. It's crucial for guiding the AI Agent's behavior when using a skill.
* **Key Elements:**
    * **Clear Instructions:** Explicitly state the task the LLM should perform (e.g., "Summarize the following incident description," "Classify this user request," "Generate a draft resolution plan").
    * **Context:** Provide necessary background information (often handled via Context Management, see below).
    * **Role Setting:** Define the persona the LLM should adopt (e.g., "You are a helpful IT support agent").
    * **Format Specification:** Define the desired output format (e.g., "Provide the summary as bullet points," "Output should be JSON").
    * **Constraints:** Set boundaries or rules (e.g., "Keep the summary under 100 words," "Only use information from the provided knowledge article").
    * **Few-Shot Examples (Optional):** Provide examples of desired input/output pairs to guide the LLM's response style and format.
* **Best Practices:**
    * **Be Specific:** Avoid ambiguity.
    * **Iterate:** Prompt engineering is often an iterative process. Test, refine, and test again.
    * **Keep it Concise:** While providing necessary detail, avoid overly long or complex prompts that might confuse the LLM.
    * **Use Placeholders:** Use variables (e.g., `${incident.description}`) within the prompt template to dynamically insert data during pre-processing or context management.
* **ServiceNow Implementation:** Prompts are configured within the Skill definition in NASK, often using Prompt Templates.

**5.4 Context Management**

* This involves providing the *right* information to the LLM *at the right time* alongside the prompt instructions. This is critical for grounding the LLM's responses in relevant, up-to-date information. AI Agents rely heavily on effective context management.
* **Methods & Tools:**
    * **Record Context:** Passing data directly from the current ServiceNow record (e.g., incident fields, work notes).
    * **Scripted Context:** Using server-side scripts (JavaScript) to fetch, process, and format data from various sources within ServiceNow (e.g., related records, user profiles).
    * **Flow Context:** Leveraging Flow Designer actions to gather and structure context.
    * **Retrievers (Key for RAG):**
        * **Purpose:** Tools that dynamically search for and retrieve relevant information to inject into the prompt context. This is the core of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
        * **Types:**
            * **Knowledge Base Search:** Retrieves relevant KB articles based on the input query or record context. Uses semantic search for better relevance.
            * **Record Search:** Finds similar records (e.g., past incidents, problems) based on context.
            * **Dataset Retriever:** Queries datasets curated using the Now Assist Data Kit (covered later).
        * **Benefit:** Allows the LLM to generate responses based on specific, current knowledge rather than just its general training data. Enhances accuracy and relevance.
    * **Short-Term Memory:** AI Agents maintain a temporary memory (often part of the Orchestrator's function) to recall recent interactions or intermediate results within a single task execution.
* **Implementation:** Configured within the Skill definition in NASK, associating specific context tools (like retrievers or scripts) with the skill.

**5.5 Post-Processing**

* This stage handles the LLM's generated output *after* it's received.
* **Purpose:**
    * **Format Output:** Convert the LLM's raw text into a specific format (e.g., JSON, update record fields).
    * **Extract Information:** Pull specific pieces of data from the LLM's response.
    * **Validate Output:** Check the response for adherence to requirements or potential issues.
    * **Trigger Actions:** Use the output to update records, initiate other workflows, or present information to the user.
    * **Parse Structured Output:** If the LLM was prompted to generate structured data (like JSON), parse it for further use.
* **Implementation:** Similar to pre-processing, often uses Scripts or Flow Designer logic configured within the Skill definition.

**(An end-to-end example implementation pulling these concepts together is mentioned in the `Now Assist Skill Kit – Implementation Guide.txt` and can be elaborated on if needed, though it might make this section very long.)**

# ServiceNow Agentic AI: Comprehensive Guide

## Part 3: Data Kit, LLM Selection, and Best Practices

### 6. Now Assist Data Kit

* **Purpose:** Now Assist Data Kit allows you to create curated, reusable datasets from your ServiceNow data (e.g., specific incident types, knowledge articles, catalog items).
* **Functionality:**
    * Define datasets based on specific tables and filter conditions.
    * Publish datasets to a data catalog.
    * Make these curated datasets available for AI Skill development and testing.
* **How it Works with Skills/Agents:**
    * **Contextual Grounding:** Datasets created with the Data Kit can be queried by "Dataset Retriever" tools within a Skill's Context Management setup. This allows AI Agents to use highly specific, curated information from your instance for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    * **Skill Testing:** Use defined datasets to provide consistent test inputs when developing and evaluating custom skills.
* **Roles:** Requires specific roles (e.g., `sn_data_kit.admin` to create/publish, `sn_data_kit.analyst` for read/edit ground truth) to manage datasets.

### 7. Choosing an LLM

Selecting the appropriate LLM is vital for the performance, cost, and compliance of your AI Agents and Skills.

* **ServiceNow NowLLM:** ServiceNow offers its own domain-specific LLMs, trained on ServiceNow data and workflows, designed for enterprise use cases on the Now Platform. These are often the preferred choice for general platform tasks.
* **Third-Party LLMs (e.g., Azure OpenAI):** ServiceNow integrates with major third-party LLM providers. These might be considered for:
    * Specific tasks where a particular external model excels.
    * Use cases requiring capabilities not yet optimized in NowLLMs.
    * Compliance or regional requirements met by a specific provider.
* **Key Selection Criteria:**
    * **Task Appropriateness:** How well does the model perform the specific task(s) required by the Skill or Agent (e.g., summarization, classification, code generation, reasoning)?
    * **Performance:** Speed (latency) and accuracy of the model's responses.
    * **Cost:** Pricing models of different providers.
    * **Data Security & Privacy:** How the provider handles your data, compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and data residency options. ServiceNow emphasizes its trust and privacy standards for NowLLM and partner integrations.
    * **Scalability:** Can the model handle the expected volume of requests?
    * **Customization/Fine-tuning:** Options available for adapting the model (though often complex and less common for general use).
    * **Alignment with ServiceNow:** NowLLMs are inherently aligned with the platform's data structures and processes.
* **Recommendation:** Start with ServiceNow NowLLMs where possible due to their integration and domain specificity. Evaluate third-party models based on specific needs and the criteria above. The choice can often be configured per Skill or Agent use case.

### 8. Best Practices, Readiness, and Governance

Implementing agentic AI successfully requires careful planning and preparation across multiple areas.

* **Quality & Completeness:**
    * Assess data for accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Poor data leads to poor AI performance.
    * Implement data quality rules and cleansing processes.
* **Transformation:** Structure data appropriately for AI consumption (e.g., clear text fields vs. complex codes).
* **Processing Speed & Indexing:** Ensure data sources (especially for RAG) are indexed efficiently for fast retrieval (e.g., AI Search indexing for KBs).
* **Data Dictionary & Standardization:** Maintain clear definitions for data fields and ensure consistent use across the platform.
* **Use-Case Specific Structuring:** Tailor data representation for specific AI tasks.
* **Retrieval & Orchestration:** Design how Agents will access and use different data sources (records, KBs, datasets).
* **Structured vs. Unstructured Data:** Plan how Agents will utilize both (e.g., structured fields from incidents, unstructured text from work notes or emails).
* **PII Masking & Security:** Crucial for compliance. Implement robust mechanisms (like ServiceNow PII masking capabilities) to prevent sensitive data from being exposed to LLMs or in generated outputs where inappropriate. (See Responsible AI below).

**8.2 Responsible AI: Compliance & Security**

Build trust and ensure ethical deployment.

* **Compliance:**
    * Understand and adhere to relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, industry-specific rules).
    * Define clear policies for AI usage, data handling, and user consent.
    * Ensure auditability of AI Agent actions and decisions.
* **Security:**
    * Protect against unauthorized access to AI models and sensitive data.
    * Secure integrations with third-party LLMs.
    * Implement PII masking/anonymization rigorously, especially before sending data to LLMs. Define which fields contain PII.
    * Monitor for potential misuse or biased outputs.
* **Practical Guidance:**
    * **Human Oversight:** Implement human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical decisions or outputs.
    * **Transparency:** Be clear about where and how AI Agents are being used. Provide visibility into how Agents make decisions (e.g., citing sources used in RAG).
    * **Fairness & Bias Mitigation:** Test for and mitigate potential biases in data and model outputs.
    * **Accountability:** Define who is responsible for the actions and outcomes of AI Agents.
    * **Now Assist Features:** Leverage built-in Now Assist safety features and ServiceNow's trust/privacy commitments.

**8.3 Organizational Change Management (OCM)**

Prepare your organization for the introduction of AI Agents.

* **Overview:** Address the people side of change to ensure adoption and value realization.
* **Preparing for Change:**
    * **Communicate Vision & Benefits:** Clearly articulate *why* AI Agents are being introduced and the expected value.
    * **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involve key stakeholders (users, managers, IT staff) early and often.
    * **Assess Impact:** Understand how AI Agents will change roles, processes, and required skills.
* **Managing Change:**
    * **Training & Education:** Provide training on how to interact with AI Agents and understand their capabilities/limitations.
    * **Support Structures:** Establish channels for users to ask questions and provide feedback.
    * **Pilot Programs:** Start with pilot groups to gather feedback and refine the solution before broad rollout.
* **Reinforcing Change:**
    * **Monitor Adoption & Value:** Track usage and measure the impact against defined KPIs.
    * **Celebrate Successes:** Share positive outcomes and user stories.
    * **Continuous Improvement:** Gather feedback and iteratively improve AI Agent performance and use cases.

**8.4 Platform Preparation & Prerequisites**

Ensure your ServiceNow instance is ready.

* **Prerequisites:** Verify necessary plugins are active (e.g., AI Agent Studio, Now Assist components, relevant workflow engines).
* **Review Features:** Understand the capabilities and limitations of the specific Now Assist and AI Agent features you plan to use.
* **Validate Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with your instance version and other customizations.
* **Activate Now Assist:** Configure and activate necessary Now Assist features and LLM connections.

**8.5 Rollout Planning**

Deploy strategically.

* **Technical Deployment:** Plan the technical steps for activating agents, skills, and use cases in production.
* **Phased Approach:** Consider rolling out to specific user groups or for limited use cases initially.
* **Monitoring & Hypercare:** Plan for close monitoring immediately after go-live to quickly address any issues.
* **Rollback Plan:** Have a contingency plan if major issues arise.
* **Communication:** Clearly communicate rollout schedules and expectations to users.

**8.6 Measuring Value and Quality**

Track the impact and ensure ongoing performance.

* **Value Measurement:**
    * Define clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) aligned with the use case objectives (e.g., reduced resolution time, improved agent productivity, cost savings, enhanced employee/customer satisfaction).
    * Establish baseline metrics before deployment.
    * Implement mechanisms to track and report on KPIs post-deployment (e.g., Performance Analytics dashboards).
* **Quality Measurement:**
    * **Accuracy:** How often does the agent perform the task correctly? (e.g., correct classification, relevant summary).
    * **Relevance:** Is the information retrieved or generated by the agent pertinent to the task?
    * **Completeness:** Does the agent provide all necessary information or complete all required steps?
    * **User Feedback:** Collect qualitative feedback from users interacting with the agents.
    * **Failure Analysis:** Analyze instances where the agent failed or produced incorrect results to identify areas for improvement (prompt tuning, context refinement, data quality issues).
    * **Testing:** Implement rigorous testing strategies (unit, integration, user acceptance) before deployment and for ongoing regression testing.
