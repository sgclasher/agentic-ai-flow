# Development Guidelines

- Follow the projectâ€™s code style and linting rules.
- Write clear, self-documenting code with descriptive names.
- Update or add docstrings and documentation for any new or changed code.
- Make atomic, logically grouped commits with descriptive messages.
- Remove dead or unused code when encountered.
- Ensure robust error handling and update logging as needed.
- Sanitize and validate all inputs; do not hardcode sensitive information.
- Consider performance and add benchmarks if relevant.
- Write or update relevant tests before implementing code changes.
- Run all tests after each change to verify correctness and prevent regressions.
- If unsure, ask for clarification or propose alternatives.
