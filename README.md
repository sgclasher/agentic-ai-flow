   - Credentials are securely passed through the Next.js API route
   - Basic authentication is used with proper encoding

2. **Data Access Layer**:
   - A scripted REST API on the ServiceNow side encapsulates data access logic
   - The API endpoint (`/api/x_nowge_rfx_ai/ai_relationship_explorer/relationships`) returns pre-formatted data
   - This approach follows the principle of least privilege - no admin access required

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - The Next.js API route normalizes the data structure to match visualization requirements
   - The FlowVisualizer component transforms the data into React Flow nodes and edges
   - The Dagre layout algorithm intelligently positions nodes based on relationships

## Core Components Explained

### FlowVisualizer.js
The main component responsible for rendering the flow diagram. It handles:
- Initialization of React Flow with custom node and edge types
- State management for nodes and edges
- Layout direction toggling (horizontal/vertical)
- Node expansion/collapse functionality
- Updating node visibility based on collapse state
- Applying the Dagre layout to visible nodes
- UI controls for layout manipulation

Key functions:
- `toggleNodeExpansion`: Toggles the expansion state of a node
- `updateChildNodesVisibility`: Updates visibility of child nodes
- `applyLayout`: Re-applies the layout algorithm after node visibility changes

### ServiceNowConnector.js
Handles the connection to ServiceNow instances:
- Provides a form UI for connection credentials
- Makes POST requests to the Next.js API route
- Securely passes credentials for authentication
- Stores connection details in the app state
- Displays connection status and errors
- Initiates data fetching process

### API Routes
The application uses Next.js API routes to securely proxy requests to ServiceNow:
- `/api/servicenow/fetch-agentic-data`: Handles authentication and data retrieval
- `/api/servicenow/get-credentials`: Manages credential validation

The API route layer:
- Keeps credentials secure (server-side only)
- Normalizes data structure for the frontend
- Handles error states and status codes
- Follows security best practices

### transformAgenticData.js
The core data transformation utility that:
- Parses ServiceNow agentic AI JSON data
- Creates React Flow nodes with appropriate data and styling
- Establishes parent-child relationships as edges
- Adds interactive properties like collapse/expand functionality
- Sorts use cases by name (which can include sequence numbers)
- Maps data fields to appropriate node properties

### layoutGraph.js
Provides intelligent node positioning using Dagre:
- `applyDagreLayout`: Organizes nodes in either horizontal or vertical layouts
- Sets node dimensions and spacing
- Processes only visible nodes
- Returns positioned nodes and edges ready for React Flow rendering

## Data Flow

1. **Data Source**: Data originates from ServiceNow's agentic AI platform
2. **Retrieval**: The data is accessed through direct ServiceNow API integration using the ServiceNowConnector
3. **Processing**:
   - Raw data is normalized by the API route if necessary
   - `transformAgenticData.js` converts normalized data to React Flow format
   - Node hierarchies and relationships are established
   - Default collapse states are applied
4. **Visualization**:
   - FlowVisualizer initializes React Flow with the processed data
   - `layoutGraph.js` positions the nodes based on relationships
   - React Flow renders the interactive diagram
5. **User Interaction**:
   - User can expand/collapse nodes to explore the hierarchy
   - Clicking nodes reveals detailed information
   - Layout can be toggled between horizontal and vertical

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security best practices:
- Uses a dedicated service account with limited permissions
- Credentials are never exposed to the client
- API route proxies requests to ServiceNow, keeping authentication server-side
- Basic authentication headers are properly encoded
- ServiceNow's script include pattern encapsulates data access logic
- Follows principle of least privilege

## AI Assistant Development Guide

### **Development Philosophy**
- **Modular First**: Break large components into focused, single-responsibility pieces
- **Security by Design**: Always validate inputs, secure API calls, never expose credentials
- **User Experience**: Prioritize intuitive interfaces and progressive disclosure
- **Performance**: Minimize re-renders, optimize large data visualizations
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### **Code Standards**
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Implement proper TypeScript types when adding TS files
- Follow consistent naming: `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for components
- Keep components under 200 lines; extract hooks for complex logic
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use descriptive variable names that explain intent

### **State Management Patterns**
- **Global State**: Use Zustand for cross-component data (see `useAgenticStore.js`)
- **Local State**: Use `useState` for component-specific state
- **Server State**: Implement proper loading/error states for API calls
- **Form State**: Consider React Hook Form for complex forms

### **Component Architecture Guidelines**
- **Container/Presentation**: Separate data logic from UI rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- **Prop Drilling**: Avoid more than 2 levels; use context or state management
- **Event Handling**: Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children

### **Performance Optimization**
- Use `React.memo` for expensive re-renders
- Implement `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for stable function references
- Lazy load large components with `React.lazy`
- Optimize React Flow with `nodesDraggable={false}` when appropriate

### **ServiceNow Integration Best Practices**
- Always use API routes as proxy layer (never direct client connections)
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use connection pooling for multiple API calls
- Validate ServiceNow response structure before processing
- Handle authentication failures gracefully

### **React Flow Specific Guidelines**
- Use custom node components for different data types
- Implement proper node memorization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Handle large datasets with virtualization if needed
- Use `fitView()` appropriately for user experience
- Implement proper edge routing for complex layouts

### **Future Feature Considerations**
- **Digital Twin Builder**: Form-based business profile creation
- **Agentic Workflow Generator**: AI-powered workflow recommendations
- **Multi-platform Support**: Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. integrations
- **ROI Calculator**: Business impact measurement tools
- **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow templates
- **Collaboration Features**: Team sharing and commenting

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Don't mutate state directly (use spread operators or state setters)
- Avoid inline object creation in JSX (causes unnecessary re-renders)
- Don't use array indices as keys for dynamic lists
- Avoid large useEffect dependency arrays
- Don't forget to cleanup subscriptions and timers
- Avoid deeply nested conditional rendering in JSX

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for utility functions (transformAgenticData, layoutGraph)
- Integration tests for API routes
- Component tests for user interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows (ServiceNow connection, visualization)
- Mock ServiceNow API responses for consistent testing

### **Quick Development Commands**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Check code style
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

### **Environment Setup**
- Node.js 18+ required
- ServiceNow instance with Agentic AI framework for testing
- Use `.env.local` for local development secrets (never commit!)
- Consider Docker for consistent development environments

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd agentic-ai-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Start the application using `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:3000)
3. Connect to ServiceNow:
   - Enter instance URL, username, password, and scope ID
   - Click "Connect & Visualize"
4. Interact with the diagram:
   - Click on nodes to view details
   - Use the +/- buttons to expand/collapse nodes
   - Use the layout buttons to switch between horizontal and vertical layouts

## ServiceNow Configuration

To integrate with ServiceNow, you'll need:
1. A ServiceNow instance with the Agentic AI framework installed
2. A user account with access to the agentic AI tables
3. A scripted REST API configured to return the agentic AI relationship data
4. The sys_id of the scope containing your agentic AI configurations

The scripted REST API should:
- Accept a scope ID parameter
- Return a structured JSON response with use cases, triggers, agents and tools
- Be accessible via basic authentication

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for the application
- **React Flow**: Library for rendering node-based graphs
- **Dagre**: Graph layout engine for organizing nodes
- **Zustand**: State management library
- **CSS Modules**: For component styling

## React Flow Implementation Notes

- Custom node types are defined outside component bodies to prevent React warnings
- Node and edge types are passed to React Flow via the `nodeTypes` and `edgeTypes` props
- Nodes use the React Flow `Handle` component for connecting edges
- Position and layout are managed via the Dagre algorithm

## Known Considerations

- Node labels with excessive length may need adjustments for optimal display
- Complex hierarchies with many nodes may require scrolling or zooming
- For best performance, limit extremely large datasets

## Browser Compatibility

The application works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
